# Create User Version of the movieDB app
A php / sql application that simulates an admin logging in to a website, and creating a user who's credentials are stored in a SQL Database

# Prerequisites
Phpmyadmin and WAMP (windows) or MAMP (Mac) are required 

# Installing
To install WAMP/MAMP, visit:

http://www.wampserver.com/en/

To install phpmyAdmin, visit:

https://www.phpmyadmin.net/



# Requirements
You will be given one week to design, research and create an admin create user
system. This system will allow the admin to login to an admin panel and create new
users.

This is a research based assignment. All code used must be commented and
explained by you as well as changed. Using tutorials/reference* is allowed, but a
straight regurgitation of the tutorial will result in a failing grade. Make it your own.
**Please supply a text file with the links to all tutorials & references used. **

# Testing
This app is in phpmyAdmin and localhost in order to simulate a user adding an entry to the database.
